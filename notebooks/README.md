# Exploratory Notebooks

The exploratory Jupyter notebooks live outside of Git because they embed large outputs. Download them from Google Drive and place them in this directory if you want to run the analyses locally.

## Download
1. Visit the shared folder: <https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1OKNq2BFnp1qWTZAk624i8iOPqbkJVvp6>
2. Download `01_listings_eda.ipynb` and `02_reviews_eda.ipynb` (plus any additional notebooks you create later).
3. Drop the files into `notebooks/` so they sit beside this README.

When committing, keep notebooks out of Git to avoid large diffs; instead, update this README and share refreshed artifacts through the Drive link above.
